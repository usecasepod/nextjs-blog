I'm struggling some with the syntax of F#, but I'm getting it bit by bit and even learning to love some aspects of it. That being said, the sample app I went through last time did nothing but peak my interest. It felt really smooth and easy to reason about, but \"Counters\" always are, right? So the next logical question is, how do we make this work for a more complicated situation?</p>\n"},{"date":"2020-05-21","title":"Exploring MVU and Functional Paradigms in Xamarin.Forms","slug":"2020-05-21-mvu-with-xamarin","author":"Austin Webre","coverImage":"","excerpt":"<p>This week saw one of Microsoft's biggest conferences transition to a completely online format. We won't discuss the fact that this year's conference was <strong>supposed</strong> to be held just 30 minutes from my house and that I was hoping to attend, but I do want to talk a bit about some of this year's announcements in the .NET space that have taken over my brain. There's plenty to be excited about - <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-analytics-clarity-in-an-instant/\">new Azure services</a>, <a href=\"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/05/19/blazor-webassembly-3-2.aspx\">production-ready (?)

It was at this point that I realized this site was missing something huge: links to our episodes on every platform! So I took some time to add links with brand images to the top nav, at which point I proudly message Clinton to get what I assumed would be resounding praise.

We're hoping that in the coming months this will become a jumping off point for us to build a community around our little show.
